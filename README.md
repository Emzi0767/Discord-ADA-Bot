#Advanced/Automatic Discord Administrator by Emzi0767

##END OF LIFE

ADA 2.x is now End-of-Life. While development won't cease for an unspecified amount of time, it will now be limited to just critical bug fixes only. From now on, new features will only be implemented in ADA 3.x.

##ABOUT

A Discord bot built on top of [Discord.NET library](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net). It's designed to simplify and automate certain administrative tasks. Supports 3rd party plugins to allow extending the functionality even further.

##RUNNING

Simply place the bot in a directory and run it. If you want to add plugins, create a `plugins` directory in the same directory that `ada.exe` is placed in, and drop your DLL files there.

##REPORTING BUGS

Bugs happen, no software is perfect. If you happen to cause the software to crash or otherwise behave in an unintended manner, make sure to let me know using via [the issue tracker](https://github.com/Emzi0767/Discord-ADA-Bot/issues). If possible, include the list of steps you took that caused the problem.
